# Spaceship sequential learning task
This is an adaptation of Nathaniel Daw's two-step decision making task.
Original code and stimuli were generously shared by Dr. Arkady Konovalov and Dr. Catherine Hartley.
I have made substantive changes/adaptations for my own purposes.
I have also adapted and added to the original stimulus set.

Please do not share or use this code without my written consent.
